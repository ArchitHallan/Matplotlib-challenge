The goal of this project is to analyse data from an animal study conducted by a pharmaceutical business. The findings come from a study of 249 mice with SCC tumour development. The mice were given a variety of medication regimens. Tumour development was watched and measured over the period of 45 days. The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Pymaceuticals' medicine of interest, Capomulin, to the performance of the other treatment regimens. The analysis includes creating all of the tables and figures required for the study's technical report, as well as a high-level summary of the study's findings.
